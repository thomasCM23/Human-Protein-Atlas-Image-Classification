## ML Checklist
1. Frame the Problem and look at the big picture.
2. Get Data.
3. Explore the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine learning algorithm.
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6. Fine-tune models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your result.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
## Personal Project Goals
- Getting a better understanding of TensorFlow library.
- Use Tensorflow's Convolutional and Pooling layers.
- Create 3 experiments, and iterate for an optimal solution for each of those experiments.
    1. Create network with LeNet5 architecture.
    2. Create network with AlexNet architecture.
    3. Use a pre-trained network and modify it for this data.
## Frame The Problem (Kaggle)
In this competition, Kagglers will develop models capable of classifying mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. The Human Protein Atlas will use these models to build a tool integrated with their smart-microscopy system to identify a protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image.

Proteins are “the doers” in the human cell, executing many functions that together enable life. Historically, classification of proteins has been limited to single patterns in one or a few cell types, but in order to fully understand the complexity of the human cell, models must classify mixed patterns across a range of different human cells.

Images visualizing proteins in cells are commonly used for biomedical research, and these cells could hold the key for the next breakthrough in medicine. However, thanks to advances in high-throughput microscopy, these images are generated at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated. Therefore, the need is greater than ever for automating biomedical image analysis to accelerate the understanding of human cells and disease.

 

Nature Methods has indicated interest in considering a paper discussing the outcome and approaches of the challenge. The Human Protein Atlas team would like to invite top performing teams to join as co-authors in the writing of this paper.

Top performing teams will also be eligible to compete for the special prize. Additional information for both the special prize and co-authoring for Nature Methods will become available through the Discussion posts once the main competition is complete.
